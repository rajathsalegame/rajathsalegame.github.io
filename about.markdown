I guess I'm supposed to talk about myself here. Or is it supposed to be about the site? Not sure. Anyways, I'm a current undergraduate at Harvard pursuing an Bachelors degree (A.B.) in Physics with a Secondary in Computer Science and a Masters degree (A.M.) in Applied Mathematics. In terms of my interests, I am currently exploring phase space, and have unfortunately yet to reach a stable equilibrium. Hopefully, we'll get there though!
